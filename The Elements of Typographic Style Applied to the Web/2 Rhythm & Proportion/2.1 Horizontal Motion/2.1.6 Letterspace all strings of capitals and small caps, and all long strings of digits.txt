2.1.6 Letterspace all strings of capitals and small caps, and all long strings of digits

â€œAcronyms such as CIA and PLO are frequent in some texts. So are abbreviations such as CE and BCE or AD and BC.
The normal value for letterspacing these sequences of small or full caps is 5% to 10% of the type size.

Many typographers like to letterspace all strings of numbers as well.
Spacing is essential for rapid reading of long, fundamentally meaningless strings such as serial numbers, and is helpful even for shorter strings such as phone numbers and dates.

Letter spacing in CSS is achieved with the aptly named letter-spacing property.
To letter space abbreviations at 10% of the type size you could wrap the abbreviations in <abbr> tags and apply a CSS rule such as:

abbr {
  letter-spacing: 0.1em;
}
