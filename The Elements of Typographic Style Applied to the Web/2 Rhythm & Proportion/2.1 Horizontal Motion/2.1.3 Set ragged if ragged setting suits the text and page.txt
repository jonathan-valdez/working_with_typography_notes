2.1.3 Set ragged if ragged setting suits the text and page

“In justified text, there is always a trade-off between evenness of word spacing and frequency of hyphenation.

Narrow measures – which prevent good justification – are commonly used when the text is set in multiple columns.
Setting ragged right under these conditions will lighten the page and decrease its stiffness.

Many unserifed faces look best when set ragged no matter what the length of the measure.
And mono-spaced fonts, which are common on typewriters, always look better set ragged.

Setting text justified or ragged is accomplished in CSS through the text-align property, as follows:

p {
  text-align: left; /* ragged right */
}

p {
  text-align: right; /* ragged left */
}

p {
  text-align: justify;
}

Effective justification of text can only be achieved if long words are hyphenated.
HTML and CSS 2 do not have any provision for automatic hyphenation and current Web browsers support, even for manual hyphenation, is poor.
So don’t justify text on the web.

Future considerations

CSS3 provides further refinement of justification within the Text Module.

For European languages, the text-justify property provides two justification options: inter-word and inter-character.

Setting inter-word selects the simplest and fastest full justification behaviour, which spreads the text evenly across the line by increasing the width of the space between words only.

No expansion or compression occurs within the words, i.e. no additional letter spacing is created.

Setting inter-character selects the justification behaviour in which both inter-word and inter-letter spacing can be expanded or reduced to spread the text across the whole line.
This is the significantly slower and more sophisticated type of the full justify behaviour preferred in newspaper and magazines.
Typically, compression is tried first. If unsuccessful, expansion occurs: inter-word spaces are expanded up to a threshold, and finally inter-letter expansion is performed. For example:

p {
  text-align: justify;
  text-justify: inter-character;
}

CSS3 also provides last line alignment with the text-align-last property. Normally the last line in a paragraph of justified text would not be justified, however if text-align-last is set to justify then the last line will be also spread evenly across the line, although in most cases this would be highly undesirable from a typographical perspective.
A potentially more useful purpose for text-align-last, at least for display text, is to set it to size. With size selected, the line content is scaled to fit on the line, so a line with fewer characters will be displayed in a larger font.
